APCminiMk24Bitwig
==============

Bitwig Studio script to support Akais APCmini Mk2 controller.

I'm sure most of it came from: http://www.mossgrabers.de/Software/Bitwig/Bitwig.html

I didn't write more than a couple lines of this, t'was mostly cutting & pasting, tweaking a couple values here & there..

Known Issues :

Crashes if one uses anything other than the classic colour scheme.<br>
Crashes if one tries to use a Group Track.<br>
The Session View can corrupt the Play View after a while.<br>
